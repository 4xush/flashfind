1. SEARCH SPEED TEST:
   - Open FlashFind
   - Type "*.pdf" 
   - Note the search time (should be < 50ms)
   
   - Open Windows Explorer
   - Navigate to C:\Users\MATRIX

   - Wait (usually 2-10 seconds)
   
   RESULT: FlashFind should be 50-200x faster

2. TYPING RESPONSIVENESS:
   - In FlashFind, type "doc" then "docu" then "docum"
   - Each keystroke should show results instantly
   
   - In Windows Explorer, do the same
   - Notice the lag between keystrokes

3. MEMORY USAGE:

   - Task Manager → Check Windows Search processes:

   - Total Windows Search memory: usually 200-500MB
